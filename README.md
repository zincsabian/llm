# llm

followed by [llm.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c/blob/master/README.md) which is a very nice repo

u can also followed [GPT2: from zero to hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8pRSuU81PU&t=527s) which is a very nice course

using device = 'mps' just because there is only 'mps' on my laptop(macbool pro with m1pro chip)

it will be better to use Nvidia GPU(cuda) to train this model

the model is gpt-2(124M), which is available for gpu which memory is more than 16G
